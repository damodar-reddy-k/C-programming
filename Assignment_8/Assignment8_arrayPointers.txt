Concepts: Arrays & Pointers

Assignment 8

1. Twenty five numbers are entered thru keyboard into an array of floats. Write a program to find out how many of then are positive, negative.

2. Write a program which swaps even and odd postion numbers in an array of 10 doubles. For eg.
	 10.1 20.3 11.4 20.4
 becomes 20.3 10.1 20.4 11.4

3. Write a program to generate prime numbers from 1 to 100 by the procedure of Sieve of Eratostenes as follow:
    a) Fill an array of num[100] with numbers from 1 to 100
    b) Starting with the 2nd entity in array, set its all multiples to zero.
    c) Proceed to the next non-zero element and set all its multiples to zero.
    d) Repeat step 3 till you have set up the multiples of all the non-zero elements to zero.
    e) At the end of step4, all the non-zero entries left in the array would be prime numbers, so print out the numbers.

4. a)Print the address and values of an array of 5 integers which is not initialized.  (use a[i], &a[i])
   b)Next initialize the array elements with values 1,2,3,4,5.  And repeat step a again.
   c)Now print values of array using a[i],i[a],*(a+i),*(i+a) and address using (a+i). Is result same.
   d) Now declare a pointer variable type integer and print values of array using pointer. 
     Eg. int *ptr;
          ptr =a ;
         for(i=0;i<5;i++){
              printf("%u \t %d",ptr,*ptr) 
             ptr++;
             }

5. Write a program to to input a matrix, display, add 2 matrices and multiply 2 matrices of size NXN by using functions
