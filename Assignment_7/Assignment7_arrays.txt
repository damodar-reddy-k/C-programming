Concepts: Arrays

Assignment

(In the below 2 problems, try to access last element of array for eg, in a[5], try to print a[5], do u get any error and share with others ur experience)

1.) Write a program which inputs a number from a user and stores a multiplication table of that number in an integer array of size 10. Then print multiplication table of number using any loop.


2.) Write a program with following specification:
   RegdNo[n] contains regdno of students  ( value of n can be chosen by you in begining like n=4 or 5. U can not ask user to enter n and then declare array. why?)
   Marks[n] contains marks of 5 students in c programming lab.

   Take the regdno and marks input from  user using for loop or while loop and then calculcate avg, max, min, median, standard deviation of marks.

Ouput should be as below:

RegdNo  Marks
01001	  10
01002   9
01003   8
01004   8.6


Avg marks:
Minimum marks:
Standard Deviation of marks:
Median of marks:

3. Write a program to sort an array of 10 numbers using bubble sort, selection sort and merge sort.
